Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req),
    the response object (res), and the next function in the application’s
    request-response cycle.
Bind application-level middleware to an instance of the app object by using the 
    app.use() and app.METHOD() functions

    functions, except with four arguments instead of three.
